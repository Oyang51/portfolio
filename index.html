		<h4>Who Am I?</h4>
			<p>Hello! My name is Owen Yang, I am 18 and a first-year student at Saint Paul College majoring in Computer Programming.</p>
		<h4>What is This Website?</h4>
			<p>This website is my final project for my web fundamentals class, and also a personal portfolio that has my resume on a different page!</p>
		<h4>A Little Bit About Me...</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>I am the oldest child of 3 kids.</li>
			<li>I am a big techy and I love building computers for my family and friends, while also learning more about computers.</li>
			<li>I am into video editing, and I am trying to learn videography and photography also.</li>
			<li>I am a huge gamer, but I also play sports when I get the chance.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Why did I choose Computer Programming as my major?</h4>
			<p>I chose this major, because I took a course in high school for computer programming and loved it! It was fun to make programs and then running them to see the final product. I am also always in front of a computer screen, so this career choice also fits with what I do most of my days.</p>
		<h4>What are my future plans?</h4>
			<p>After college, I want to join a big game company and program for them since I love gaming and I would love to be a part of the process in making the game. I also want to do photography and videography as a side job since it's my hobby and I would still want to keep my hobbies close to me.</p>
